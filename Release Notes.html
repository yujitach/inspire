    <dt>1.6.3 (May/5/2015)</dt>
    <dd>
        Increased the maximum number of "arXiv/recents" to 999. Many thanks to Ben Gripaios for the suggestion!
    </dd>
    <dt>1.6.2 (Apr/29/2015)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixed a bug introduced in 1.6.1. Internals are somewhat rewritten to better isolate object accesses from different threads. Hopefully it leads to less crashes.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.6.1 (Mar/15/2015)</dt>
    <dd>Supports multiple bib files of the form \bibliography{first,second,third}. New entries are written to first.bib. If you didn't know about the bib file management feature of this app, please go to <a href="http://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/spires/">the webpage</a> and have a look at the third video!
    </dd>
    <dt>1.6.0 (Jan/6/2015)</dt>
    <dd>The previous update was not enough to cope with the new identifiers, due to the stupid reason that 20150100001 &gt; 2<sup>31</sup>. Changed internals to 64 bits.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.5.9 (Dec/10/2014)</dt>
    <dd>Updated the internals to cope with the new 1501.nnnnn identifiers; more fixes of bugs reported by Flip. </dd>
    <dt>1.5.8 (May/29/2014)</dt>
    <dd>A bug fix in the bibtex key generation, thanks to Flip Tanedo.</dd>
    <dt>1.5.7 (Dec/17/2013)</dt>
    <dd>Small change to make the app stabler on Mavericks.</dd>
    <dt>1.5.6 (Nov/25/2013)</dt>
    <dd>Abstracts of old articles from Springer and Elsevier are again acquired automatically. Removed invisible animation to reduce energy consumption. </dd>
    <dt>1.5.5 (Oct/23/2013)</dt>
    <dd>Small update before OS X 10.9 Marvericks. Apple announced Marvericks is free, so you're encouraged to update!</dd>
    <dt>1.5.4 (Oct/19/2013)</dt>
    <dd>The app now looks better on laptops with higher-density (retina) displays.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.5.3 (Oct/11/2013)</dt>
    <dd>More bug fixes. My thanks go to Tomer and Luca for reporting them. Shift-return and reloading data from the inspire web server should now work more reliably. It should work on 10.9 Mavericks too.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.5.2 (Sep/10/2013)</dt>
    <dd>Bug fixes for 1.5.1. My sincere thanks go to Jure, Kin-ya, Micha, and as always, Ryo. Dear friends, please do tell me any bugs you found. That would save a lot of your colleagues' time eventually!
    </dd>
    <dt>1.5.1 (Sep/7/2013)</dt>
    <dd>Removed the live search feature, because it was too slow when the database file became ~100Mbytes. Other small changes. The internals are being renovated.

    </dd>
    <dt>1.4.8 (May/6/2012)</dt>
    <dd>Small bug fixes (thanks to Geoffrey.) Now signed correctly so it should work on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.

        <dt>1.4.5 (Jul/19/2011)</dt>
        <dd>Fixed a bug which prevents launching the app on Lion when the database is big.
        <div class="warning">Please install this before upgrading to Lion!</div>
        </dd>

        <dt>1.4.2 (May/1/2011)</dt>
        <dd>Bug fixes. Arxiv reload buttons are slightly moved, as a precaution to transition to Lion. I'm sorry for the change, but please get used to it.</dd>

	<dd>Now supports the Inspire database as the backend.</dd>
	<dt>1.3.3 (Sep/6/2010)</dt>
	<dd>One bug fix so that you can read today's hep-th. Stricly speaking, the bug is on the arxiv server: the XHTML file it serves states it uses UTF8, but in reality the abstract of an entry was in Latin-1. 
	This confused my app. Alas. (Sep/7: the admin of the arxiv corrected the database itself, so the version 1.3.2 will work. But you're encouraged to update it anyway.)</dd>

	<div class="warning">Please do report whatever inconvenience and/or a bug you found to me. Don't think it might bother me; I heartily welcome it. 
	Your one email can improve the lives of ~100 other theorists!</div>
	</dd>
	<dt>1.3 (Feb/1/2010)</dt>
	<dd><span class="warning">This update will again upgrade the database format and there is no going back.</span>
	Massive speed improvements (thanks to Michele for ideas), UI polish (thanks to Ryo), etc. 
	Please see the <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~yujitach/spires/">homepage</a> for detailed info.

	<dd><span class="warning">This update will upgrade the database format and there is no going back.</span> <br/>

	<dd>Minor bug fixes.<dd>
	<dt>0.93 (Feb/1/2009)</dt>
	<dd>0.92 had a nasty crasher. (It seems one needs to compare bundle ids case insensitively...) Should be fixed now.</dd>
	<dt>0.92 (Feb/1/2009)</dt>
	<dd>Incorporated some suggestions. (bibtex query, arxiv/replacements etc.) It involved a rather massive rewrite;

	<dt>0.91 (Jan/28/2009)</dt>
	<dd>Now shows a link to the journal webpage if it can be guessed and no eprint is available.

	My sloppy coding starts to slow down the response of the app once there are more than 3000 entries in the database...
	Maybe I need to clean up the code and optimize. Ugh.)</dd>
