    <dt>2.0.6.1 (Nov/17/2021)</dt>
    <dd>
        An extremely stupid but visible bug introduced in 2.0.6 was fixed
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.6 (Nov/16/2021)</dt>
    <dd>
        Minor visual tweaks for Big Sur and later
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.5 (Oct/24/2021)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixed a stupid but serious bug where the app refused to connect to the inspire web server, because
        old.inspirehep.net was finally discontinued last week. Thank you very much for everyone who reported the issue.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.4 (Jan/25/2021)</dt>
    <dd>
        Reordered toolbar icons on Big Sur; a small bug fix reported by Suzuki-kun.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.3 (Nov/30/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        It is now compiled also for Apple Silicon, although I do not have it yet. If you are an Apple Silicon user and find some problem, please do report it to me!
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.2 (Nov/23/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        You can drag &amp; drop a PDF to the article info view to register it again.
        This basic feature was broken in 2.0.0 due to my code change to modernize the internals.
        I'd like to thank Nori Iizuka to catch it.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.1 (Nov/12/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        You can copy &amp; paste from the article info view again.
        This basic feature was broken in 2.0.0 due to a conflict of a latest change with a line of code remaining from 2009.
        I'd like to thank Boris Pioline to catch it.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.0 (Nov/12/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Minimal Big Sur support. The major version number increase from 1.9.9 to 2.0.0 does not mean anything significant, just as the jump from Catalina 10.15 to Big Sur 11 does not mean much.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.9 (Nov/4/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        "refers to" should really work now, which stopped working since 1.9.6.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.8 (Nov/1/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixes a bug where trying to create a "playlist" in the sidebar caused a crash, introduced due to an ongoing rewrite to adapt to Big Sur.
    </dd>

    <dd>
        Fixes a major bug where "cited by" and "refers to" of pre-arxiv articles didn't work.
        I don't know when this bug was introduced;
        most probably it was in the 1.9.0 rewrite in June 2020.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.6 (Oct/19/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixes a bug introduced in 1.9.5, where you couldn't get new bibtex entries.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.5 (Oct/18/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        The cancel button is finally back! Just click ðŸ…§ in the blinking message bubble in the bottom-right corner.
        As I'm making many internal changes, things which used to work might be broken.
        Please do not hesitate to write to me if you find something.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.4 (August/26/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixes another major bug introduced by the rewrite:
        "cited by" with more than 50 papers wasn't working. Sad!
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.3 (July/5/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixes another minor bug introduced by the rewrite:
        old papers not on the arXiv should now be sorted more appropriately.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.2 (June/23/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixes another major bug introduced by the rewrite:
        Looking up citations of a paper should work more reliably.
        I'm sorry for the messes.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.1 (June/22/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixes a major bug introduced by the rewrite:
        Looking up references of a paper should work again.
    </dd>
    <dt>1.9.0 (June/17/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        The internal is modified so that this app continues to work with the new inspire hep webpage and api.
        There might be new bugs introduced by this change.
        If you find any, please do not hesitate to write to Yuji.
    </dd>

    <dd>
        Mojave's dark mode support in v1.8.1 was broken. It's hopefully fixed now.

    </dd>
    <dt>1.5.3 (Oct/11/2013)</dt>

	<dd>Now supports the Inspire database as the backend.</dd>
	<dt>1.3.3 (Sep/6/2010)</dt>
	<dd>One bug fix so that you can read today's hep-th. Stricly speaking, the bug is on the arxiv server: the XHTML file it serves states it uses UTF8, but in reality the abstract of an entry was in Latin-1. 
	This confused my app. Alas. (Sep/7: the admin of the arxiv corrected the database itself, so the version 1.3.2 will work. But you're encouraged to update it anyway.)</dd>

	<div class="warning">Please do report whatever inconvenience and/or a bug you found to me. Don't think it might bother me; I heartily welcome it. 
	Your one email can improve the lives of ~100 other theorists!</div>
	</dd>
	<dt>1.3 (Feb/1/2010)</dt>
	<dd><span class="warning">This update will again upgrade the database format and there is no going back.</span>
	Massive speed improvements (thanks to Michele for ideas), UI polish (thanks to Ryo), etc.

	<dd><span class="warning">This update will upgrade the database format and there is no going back.</span> <br/>

	<dt>0.92 (Feb/1/2009)</dt>
	<dd>Incorporated some suggestions. (bibtex query, arxiv/replacements etc.) It involved a rather massive rewrite;

	<dd>Now shows a link to the journal webpage if it can be guessed and no eprint is available.

	My sloppy coding starts to slow down the response of the app once there are more than 3000 entries in the database...
